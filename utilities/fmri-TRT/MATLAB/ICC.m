% Intraclass Correlation Coefficient
%
% [ICC] = ICC(X, model, rating)
%         returns the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient of X
%
% The input X is an n x k matrix, where n is the number of tar-
% gets and k the number of judges. ICCs are divided into three 
% models for two types of ratings.
%
% Model Types:
% '1' = random effects model => a different group of k judges, 
%       who have been selected from a larger population of jud-
%       ges, rate each target
% '2' = mixed effects model => the same group of k judges, who 
%       have been selected from a larger population of judges, 
%       rate each target
% '3' = fixed effects model => the same group of k judges, who 
%       are the only judges of interest, rate each targets.
%
% Rating Types:
% '1' = individual rating
% 'k' = mean of several ratings
